# Raspberry Pi CPU Temperature Chart
This script makes a chart and tells you the cpu temp of your raspberry pi it also records the temperature in a file called temprecords.txt. 
The first input will ask you how many times you want to pull the CPU temperature and graph the it, and the second option asks you the time between pulls. 
You can figure out how long this program will run by calculating *intervals(sec) x the times ran = time(sec)*

 I used this project to test my PI with and without a fan.
